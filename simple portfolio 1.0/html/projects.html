		<p><b>--> Sitemap generator for <a href="http://www.discuz.eu/">Discuz!</a> forum.</b></p>
		<p>PHP based plugin for Discuz! forum that generates a XML sitemap of the forum,threads,subthreads. I wrote this 2 years ago. This plugin is very loosely written and badly formatted. I will update it as soon as i find time :) (atleast it get things done hehe.).

		<p><b>--> Addon for <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-pro-quiz/">WP-Pro-Quiz - Wordpress</a></b></p>
		<p>This PHP addon accepts a text file in which MCQ question are there with answers in a particular format. It grabs the questions,options,answers and creates a XML file that is accepted by WP-Pro-Quiz plugin. You can see the MCQs created using this on my <a href="http://notesnation.com">website - Notesnation.com</a>. Just click on any of the MCQ. More details and the code will be uploaded here once i finish UI part.</p>
		
		<p><b>--> User level -Plugin for <a href="https://mybb.com/">MyBB form(similar to vBulletin)</a></b></p>
		<p>This plugin gives you points for posting/commenting on the forum . A "level" bar is displayed below the username that fills up as you gain points. Based upon the points the user is given designations and badges. I plan to upload the plugin here, again it is very loosely written and badly formatted as i wrote it in around 2012.</p>
