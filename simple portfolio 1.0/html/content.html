		<p>Hello there, i am Aditya Pushkar from Bihar,Patna. My internet alias is "adi555j". A quick google search will reveal my past schenanigans.</p> 
		<p>I have always been curious about "things" and how those "things" work. I "discovered" internet when i was in 8th class. My father had a Nokia-3210 (240x320 res screen). One day i discovered that i can browse websites and download java games in that(good old opera mini days). I dived into the WAP internet world and started making basic html,css websites. It took almost 10 days for me to realise that index.html is the page displayed when someone requests a web address. </p>
		<p>Then i decided to dive into PHP as i wanted to write my own forum. PHP is like my first love(literally). The elegance of PHP amazes me and it get things done. I self taught myself PHP and a bit of OOPS.</p>
		<p>College days were tough times, I was involved in several small projects and learned C++,C,MySql and moved to some serious php development.</p>
